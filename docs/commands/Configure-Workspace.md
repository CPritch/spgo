## Command Name
`SPGo: Configure Workspace`

## Description
The Configure Workspace command will activate SPGo inside Visual Studio code, create a new project and initialize the base configuration (`spgo.json`) file. Once the `spgo.json` file is present at the root of a workspace, SPGo will automatically initialize every time the folder is opened with Visual Studio Code.
