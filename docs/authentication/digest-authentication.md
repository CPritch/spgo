title: Digest Authentication
---

Digest authentication is commonly used by SharePoint Online (Office 365). Your username will take the format of an email address when prompted for login credentials.

## Additional Configuration

To specify Digest authentication, set the `authenticationType` property to `Digest` in your `spgo.json` file, or by selecting the "Digest" option when configuring your local environment with the `SPGO> Configure Workspace` command.
